Hi! My name is Muyao Li (李沐遥). I am an undergraduate student in the Tong Class at Peking University, and currently an intern in the [CraftJarvis](https://github.com/CraftJarvis) team. You can reach me at li_muyao@stu.pku.edu.cn.

My research focuses on building generalized agents that unify perception, reasoning, and decision-making within an end-to-end foundation model. My current work centers on deploying such agents in games.

**Research Interests**: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Reasoning, Embodied Intelligence, LLM Agents
